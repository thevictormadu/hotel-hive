# HotelHive Management API
HotelHive API is a web-based application built with .NET framework that enables hotel managers and employees to effectively manage their hotel operations.
This API will facilitate the integration of various software applications to help hoteliers manage their hotels more efficiently, increasing their revenue and profit margins.

## Features:
HotelHive API has a range of features that can be tailored to suit the specific needs of each hotel, including:

- A booking engine that allows guests to reserve rooms online, view availability, and manage their reservations
- A room management system that enables the hotel staff to view and manage room inventory, allocate room assignments, and track occupancy rates
- A rate management system that allows hotel staff to set rates for different room types, apply discounts and promotions, and monitor pricing across different channels
- A payment gateway integration that facilitates online payments and automates billing processes
- An inventory management system that enables hoteliers to manage their supplies and orders from vendors
- A customer relationship management (CRM) system that stores guest profiles, preferences, and past stays, and enables targeted marketing campaigns

## Technology:
HotelHive API is built using the .NET framework, which is a widely used and stable technology for building enterprise-level applications.
The API is designed to be scalable, robust, and secure, with data encryption, access control, and authentication mechanisms in place to protect sensitive information.
The API is also designed to be integrated with other third-party software applications and platforms through APIs and webhooks.
